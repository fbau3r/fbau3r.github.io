I found a treasure in PuTTY docs: [Making Pageant run another program](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.64/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant-cmdline-command)

So, the first time started, pageant asks for your key's password, then starts PuTTY. Every following start (while Pageant keeps running) does not bother you for a password.

Nice!
